# Mockup-ATM-Profile-Input-Output
This is a activity that I did for my exam in Computer Programming 1. This C++ program can output a Mockup ATM Profile in a .txt file. All of the created files will be saved inside the solution project, the same files that I mentioned can also be viewed through the program.

Features:
1. You can register a mockup ATM Account using this program.
2. You can edit the following values in your Mockup ATM Account:
	1. Balance
	2. House Number, Street, Barangay and/or City Address Values.
	3. Age\n
	4. Gender (Male, Female, Neutral)
	5. Username (this includes the filename as well).
	6. Password
3. You can also be able to Delete your Account.
4. After you're done modifying your Mockup ATM Profile, you can then Log Out.
5. You can view back your old Mockup ATM account through the same program. Just type in your old file/account name.
